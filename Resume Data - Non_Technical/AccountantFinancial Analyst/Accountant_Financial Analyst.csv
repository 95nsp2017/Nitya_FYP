 PCM was not my cup of tea, hence I bid adieu to it & had embraced my new journey with Business Studies, Accounting & Economics
  
 The word Audit caught my attention during career counseling session & hence I became determined to be a CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTðŸŽ“
 
 Apart from learning subjects like Auditing & Taxation, Financial Reporting, Accounting Standards, Financial Management & Costing, the Chartered Accountancy course helped me become individual independent at a very young age.
 
 I started my corporate career in January 2016 working for Deutsche Bank Pune as Financial Analyst wherein along with Ms excel I became familiar with other Financial Planning, Reporting & Analytical Tools like 
 
 ðŸ’ GGL - BCS
 ðŸ’ SAS
 ðŸ’ Qlikview
 ðŸ’ Jedox
 
 Other than understanding Financial tools, I also learned -
 
 ðŸ’ Variance Analysis & writing commentaries
 ðŸ’ Report development
 ðŸ’ Process setup
 
 and extract Financial data from multiple sources, make it presentable using excel think-cell charts, automated excel macros for our stakeholders
 
 Apart from a regular book of work, I also enjoy participating in multiple team building & CSR activities
 
 Going forward I joined Deutsche Bank Pune Toastmaster club where I realized I love mentoring peopleðŸ’—
 
 I learned how to give constructive feedback & was able to win 3rd position for Speech Evaluation Contest at the club levelðŸ†
 
 Natural strengths that had positively contributed towards my career 
 â˜† Thinking strategically rather than jumping to conclusions
 â˜† Empathy & harmony
 â˜† Connectedness
 â˜† Adaptability
 
 During the lockdown, I started developing an interest in understanding Python 
 
 I had participated in learning Financial Analytics using Python from XLRI.
 
 I prefer doing things at my own pace rather than pressurizing myself.
 
 Playing badminton, sometimes dancing or simply listening to music can instantly cheer me up

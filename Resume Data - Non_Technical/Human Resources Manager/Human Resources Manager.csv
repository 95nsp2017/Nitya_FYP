The current curriculum heavily falls short in that. Hence, we have designed a skill development Programme that will compensate for all those short comings. Our Programme solely focuses on getting the best jobs available in the market right at the entrance level. This also clears the path to a successful and directed career in the industry. Our programme will train in the latest and most in demand skills in the industry. The training will not be a text book based rather real time concepts of the industry. During the entire training process students will get the look and feel of the corporate culture. It will prepare students for future Job interviews. With their increased exposure to the gamut of Industry and additional analytical skills they will crack the interview easily in comparison to the others who compete.
 My responsibilities in simplifying skills are to collaborate with the IT companies and campuses.

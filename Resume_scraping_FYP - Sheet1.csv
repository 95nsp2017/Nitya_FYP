The current curriculum heavily falls short in that. Hence, we have designed a skill development Programme that will compensate for all those short comings. Our Programme solely focuses on getting the best jobs available in the market right at the entrance level. This also clears the path to a successful and directed career in the industry. Our programme will train in the latest and most in demand skills in the industry. The training will not be a text book based rather real time concepts of the industry. During the entire training process students will get the look and feel of the corporate culture. It will prepare students for future Job interviews. With their increased exposure to the gamut of Industry and additional analytical skills they will crack the interview easily in comparison to the others who compete.
 My responsibilities in simplifying skills are to collaborate with the IT companies and campuses.

 PCM was not my cup of tea, hence I bid adieu to it & had embraced my new journey with Business Studies, Accounting & Economics
  
 The word Audit caught my attention during career counseling session & hence I became determined to be a CHARTERED ACCOUNTANTðŸŽ“
 
 Apart from learning subjects like Auditing & Taxation, Financial Reporting, Accounting Standards, Financial Management & Costing, the Chartered Accountancy course helped me become individual independent at a very young age.
 
 I started my corporate career in January 2016 working for Deutsche Bank Pune as Financial Analyst wherein along with Ms excel I became familiar with other Financial Planning, Reporting & Analytical Tools like 
 
 ðŸ’ GGL - BCS
 ðŸ’ SAS
 ðŸ’ Qlikview
 ðŸ’ Jedox
 
 Other than understanding Financial tools, I also learned -
 
 ðŸ’ Variance Analysis & writing commentaries
 ðŸ’ Report development
 ðŸ’ Process setup
 
 and extract Financial data from multiple sources, make it presentable using excel think-cell charts, automated excel macros for our stakeholders
 
 Apart from a regular book of work, I also enjoy participating in multiple team building & CSR activities
 
 Going forward I joined Deutsche Bank Pune Toastmaster club where I realized I love mentoring peopleðŸ’—
 
 I learned how to give constructive feedback & was able to win 3rd position for Speech Evaluation Contest at the club levelðŸ†
 
 Natural strengths that had positively contributed towards my career 
 â˜† Thinking strategically rather than jumping to conclusions
 â˜† Empathy & harmony
 â˜† Connectedness
 â˜† Adaptability
 
 During the lockdown, I started developing an interest in understanding Python 
 
 I had participated in learning Financial Analytics using Python from XLRI.
 
 I prefer doing things at my own pace rather than pressurizing myself.
 
 Playing badminton, sometimes dancing or simply listening to music can instantly cheer me up
